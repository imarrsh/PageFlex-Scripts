# PageFlex-Scripts
These are external scripts that I wrote for PageFlex projects to control content and appearance of documents. These are really just to put out there as free examples. They may provide an insight to other PageFlex Developers that want to incorporate and use script variables in their projects. They also represent a progression in my own learning of Javascript and using it to work with PageFlex Studio.
